  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Due to the custom and digital nature of our work, most purchases and services are
    non refundable. By working with San Roku Ku or purchasing from us you agree to the
    terms below.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Digital Products</h2>
  <p>
    All purchases of digital items and downloads, such as rentals, streaming content, or
    digital files, are final and non refundable once access has been provided. This includes
    issues related to device compatibility, internet connection, or a change of mind.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Creative And Production Services</h2>
  <p>
    Services such as poster design, trailer editing, web development, and consulting are
    custom and time based. Once work has begun or time has been booked, fees are non
    refundable. This includes situations where creative direction changes or the project is
    cancelled by the client.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Technical Issues</h2>
  <p>
    If you experience technical problems accessing a digital product or delivery, please
    contact us within 48 hours at <strong>support@sanrokuku.com</strong>. We will try to
    restore access or provide a suitable alternative, but this does not guarantee a refund.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Unauthorised Payments</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for keeping your account and payment details secure. If you suspect
    fraud or unauthorised use, please contact your payment provider and then notify us. We
    reserve the right to investigate and to dispute chargebacks we consider invalid.
  </p>

  <h2>5. No Guarantee Of Outcomes</h2>
  <p>
    For services involving strategy, marketing, or distribution we cannot guarantee specific
    financial results, audience numbers, or platform acceptance. Our fees relate to the work
    carried out, not to particular outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be
    available on this page.
